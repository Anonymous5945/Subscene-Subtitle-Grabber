bad debt
a fish out of water
at home in
in addition to
make good 
bring up
without fail
keep to
hue and cry 
in the nick of time
a square meal
fall in
look up 
birds eye view
hard and fast
a stone throw away
bread and butter
to end in smoke
tooth and nail
come across
turn turtle 
time and again 
royal road
high and mighty
call out
get through 
beat about the bush
bring to book 
go to the wall
to split hairs
apple of one's eye
a blue stocking
give a false colouring to
once in a blue moon
sit on the fence
a fool's paradise
better half
keep pace with
go away 
call in 
in black and white
red tape 
part and parcel
to the letter
hand over
let down
a blessing in disguise
a fair weather friend
have an axe to grind
on behalf of
end in smoke 
pass away
in a fix 
pocket an insult
wet blanket
back up
take to 
pass for 
pull through
from a scratch
to steal a march upon
get into
through thick and thin
tide over
take to task
rank and file
blow out
cry up 
few and far between
turn over a new leaf
add insult to injury 
blind alley
to get wind of
in the doldrum
run over
fall foul of 
by fits and starts
all at sea
a childs play
as coal as cucumber
to come to light
break the news
a bed of roses
see off
come off
all at sea
to be in a fix
wild goose chase
turn a deaf ear 
to fixsh in troubled 
take after
to cut a sorry figure 
to fall flat
to call names
small talk
to smell a rat
show the white feather
safe and sound
to poke one's nose
with might and main
make after
put up with 
at arms length 
a black sheep 
add fuel to fire
broken health
agree with
call over
abide by
get into hot water 
apple pie order
a dark horse
die in harness
kick the bucket
call for
give in
a red letter day 
in a nutshell
a close fisted man
get rid of
give up 
give vent to 
lame excuse
to play truant
to put up with
to fall out
break out
by and large
time and tide
call for 
hold down 
bag and baggage
in a full swing
make head way
carry out
a bone of contention
a hard nut to crack
at the eleventh hour
a storm in a tea cup
make up for
do away with
by hook or by crook
keep on
heart and soul
to the back bone
make both ends meet
a bold from the blue
fair play
break away
check by jowl 
get through
blow hot and cold 
part with
bring up
burn midnight oil
put off
go a long way
face the music
leave in the lunch
kith and kin
nip in the bud
under the cloud 
at stake
at daggers drawn
turn out
all and sundry 
lay down
to take a fancy to
broken read
turn down
come to blows
break into 
down and out
give up
in the teeth of
bed of thorns 
lose one's temper
look sharp
look forward to
a childs play
make out
run into
take for
french leave
set in 
an eye wash 
take down
bring to light
break through
to call a spade a spade
in cold blood
